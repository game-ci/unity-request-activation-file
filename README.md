# Unity - Request Activation File
[Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for requesting the manual activation file, used to acquire a Unity personal license.

Required for the 
[Activate](https://github.com/webbertakken/unity-actions#activate),
[Test](https://github.com/webbertakken/unity-actions#test) and
[Build](https://github.com/webbertakken/unity-actions#build)
actions from the 
[Unity Actions](https://github.com/webbertakken/unity-actions) 
collection.

## Usage

Create a file called `.github/workflows/activation.yml` and add a job to it.
 
```yaml
name: Acquire activation file
on: [push]
jobs:
  activation:
    name: Request manual activation file ðŸ”‘
    steps:
```

To **configure** this action, add this step and set the id.

```yaml
      # Request manual activation file
      - name: Request manual activation file
        uses: webbertakken/unity-request-manual-activation-file@v1
        id: getManualLicenseFile
```

You use the id to **upload the output file** like so:     

```yaml
      # Upload artifact (Unity_v20XX.X.XXXX.alf)
      - name: Expose as artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
          path: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
```

Commit and push your workflow definition.
